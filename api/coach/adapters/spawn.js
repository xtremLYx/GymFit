/* Running a provider CLI as a child process, with the blast radius kept small.
 *
 * Three things matter here and none of them are about convenience:
 *   · no shell, ever — argv is an array, and the user's free text never reaches it anyway
 *     (it travels inside the payload file, as JSON data)
 *   · the environment is built from nothing rather than inherited, so the child cannot read
 *     RP_ID, ADMIN_UIDS, VAPID keys or anything else this process holds
 *   · the child runs as an unprivileged user (created in the Dockerfile) whose uid cannot
 *     read ./data, so a CLI that decided to go looking finds nothing to find
